[](https://dutchopticscentre.com/news/optical-wireless-superhighways-free-photons-at-home-and-in-space-free/)Our project on joint optic and wireless communication has been awarded by the NWO! This is a 5 years massive undertaking with many stakeholders on building better optical communication solutions both in the sky and on the ground. Check it out [here](https://dutchopticscentre.com/news/optical-wireless-superhighways-free-photons-at-home-and-in-space-free/)!

I will be involved in Designing SDN solutions for Free Space Optic Satellite communication. Stey tuned for a new PhD vacancy...or send me an email if you want to know more.

Together with our colleagues at TU Delft , TU/Eindhoven, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Leiden University we will be working with 15 partners to create reliable and secure wireless broadband connections using light instead of radio waves. Expectation is that in this way you can send and process digital data at high speeds, with minimum delays and in a secure manner. The consortium will receive â‚¬ 4.1 million for this research from the NWO Perspectief program.

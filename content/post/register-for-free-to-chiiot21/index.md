### **The 1st CHIIoT workshop (CHIIoT 1) will be held on Feb. 17, 2pm - 5pm (CET).**

The *CHIIoT* workshop series bring together researchers and practitioners from HCI design, computer science, and electrical engineering working on new challenges in industry and academia. The workshop will provide a platform for participants to review and discuss challenges and opportunities in the intersection of computer-human interaction and the internet of things, focusing on human-centered applications using emerging connectivity and sensing technologies. We aim to jointly develop a design space and identify opportunities for future research. The first workshop (CHIIoT 1) will be co-located with **[EWSN 2021](https://ewsn2021.ewi.tudelft.nl/)**: The 18th International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks.
